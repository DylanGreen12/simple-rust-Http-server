Hello, this is a basic http server in rust. To run this you can use either:
1. Go to the root directory in command line and run 'cargo build' and 'cargo run'
2. You can also run 'cargo build --release' to create an exe that the shortcut in root is for
3. Then visit the address it generates

If you need to install rust here is a link to the official website: 
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
Just follow the instructions here and if you need more help, a manual is included in the files
